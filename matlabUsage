My MATLAB usage notes

Shortcuts:
Evalue Selection: option-cmd-E 

run 'function bank' in CLI, it will report large numbers in decimal instead of scientific notation

operations on matrices on by one, almost always go through columns first: top to bottom, then next column top to bottom, then next, etc.
