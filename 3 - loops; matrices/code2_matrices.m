%% more mathematical operations on matrices

a = rand(3);
c = sin(a)     % pass a matrix to a mathematical function, get a matrix back
c = inv(a)     % matrix inverse
c = a'         % matrix transpose

min(a)         % minimum of each column, or of a row vector
min(a,[],1)    % minimum of each column
min(a,[],2)    % minimum of each row

min(min(a))    % minimum of a whole m x n matrix
min(a(:))      % minimum of a whole matrix

max(a)         % maximum of each column, or of a row vector
max(a,[],1)    % maximum of each column

sum(a)         % sum of each column, or of a row vector
sum(a,1)       % sum of each column

%% more on subscript indices

a = rand(5);
b = a(1,end-1)      % use 'end-1' to get the second last element in a row
b = a(:)            % convert a to a column vector

a = rand(1,10);
a(3) = []           % delete an element
a(1:3) = []         % delete several elements


%% logical indices

a = rand(3);
b = a>0.5          % get a matrix of ones and zeros that indicate which
                   % elements meet some criterion

k = sum(b(:))      % count the elements that meet the criterion
k = sum(a(:)>0.5)  % same thing, more concisely
                
c = a(b)           % get the elements that meet the criterion

a(b) = 0           % set the elements that meet the criterion to some value
a( a>0.5 ) = 0     % same thing, more concisely

x = rand(5);       % get some random numbers
y = rand(5);       % get some random numbers
sum( x( y>0 ) )    % get the sum of all x's where the corresponding y's meet a criterion
                   % (useful in data analysis, e.g., find mean reaction
                   %  over all trials where stimulus was type A)

e = any(b(:))      % see if any elements meet the criterion
f = all(b(:))      % see if all elements meet the criterion

% logical operators
g = a>0.1 & a<0.2
g = ( a>0.1 & a<0.2 ) | ~( a<0.95 )

% logical indices must be type 'logical'


%% linear indices

% column major order

a = rand(5);
b = a(1)            % get an element using linear indices
b = a([ 1 2 3 ])    % get multple elements using multiple indices
b = a(1:5)          % use a range
b = a(6:end)        % use 'end'
b = a(:)            % convert to column vector

f = find(a>0.5)     % get the indices for the entries that meet some criterion
b = a(f)            % get the entries that meet the criterion

f = find( ( a>-1 | a<1 ) & ~abs(a)<0.01 )    % more complex criteria
b = a(f)            % get the entries that meet the criterion

a([ 1 2 3 ]) = 0    % any of the above can appear on the left side
f = find(a>0.5);
a(f) = 0            

a([ 1 2 3 ]) = [ 10 20 30 ]  % can assign multiple values
